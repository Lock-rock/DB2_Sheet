The SYSCAT schema in IBM Db2 contains system catalog views and tables that provide metadata about the database objects and configuration settings. It serves as a catalog or repository of information about the database schema, tables, indexes, views, and more.
Here are some commonly used objects in the SYSCAT schema:

Views:

syscat.TABLES: Contains information about tables defined in the database, such as their names, schema, creation time, and table type.
syscat.COLUMNS: Provides details about columns in the tables, including their names, data types, lengths, and positions.
syscat.INDEXES: Contains information about indexes defined on tables, including index names, table names, and column names.
syscat.VIEWS: Provides details about views defined in the database, such as view names, view definitions, and creation time.
Tables:

syscat.TABLESPACES: Contains information about table spaces defined in the database, including their names, types, and storage details.
syscat.INDEXES: Similar to the INDEXES view but in table format, providing more detailed information about indexes.
syscat.ROUTINES: Contains details about user-defined functions (UDFs), stored procedures, and triggers defined in the database.
These views and tables in the SYSCAT schema can be queried to retrieve metadata about the database objects and configuration settings. They provide valuable information for tasks such as database administration, performance tuning, and application development. Keep in mind that querying objects in the SYSCAT schema may require appropriate permissions, and the specific objects available may vary depending on the version and edition of Db2 you are using.
